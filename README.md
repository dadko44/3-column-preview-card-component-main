## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

### What I learned

Using more appropriate HTML tags
```html
<section class="car-type-section sedans-section">
  <img src="images/icon-sedans.svg">
  <h1>Sedans</h1>
  <p>
    Choose a sedan for its affordability and excellent fuel economy. Ideal for cruising in the city
    or on your next road trip.
  </p>
  <button type="button" class="sedans-color">Learn More</button>
</section>
```
Storing often used colors in CSS variables
```css
:root{
    --sedans-color: hsl(31, 77%, 52%);
    --suvs-color: hsl(184, 100%, 22%);
    --lux-color: hsl(179, 100%, 13%);
}
```
```
